          <h2 class="question">Why is data structures important to learn ?</h2>
          <p class="answer">Data structures and algorithms play a major role in implementing software 
          and in the hiring process as well. A lot of students and professionals have
          this question that why these companies’ interviews are focused on DSA instead 
          of language/frameworks/tools specific questions? Let us explain why it happens… 
          When you ask someone to make a decision for something the good one will be able to tell you
          “I choose to do X because it’s better than A, B in these ways. I could have gone with C,
          but I felt this was a better choice because of this“. In our daily life, we always go with that
          person who can complete the task in a short amount of time with efficiency and using fewer resources. 
          The same things happen with these companies. The problem faced by these companies is much harder and on a much larger scale. Software developers also have to make the right decisions when it comes to solving the problems of these companies. Knowledge of data structures like Hash Tables, Trees, Trees, Graphs, and various algorithms goes a long way in solving these problems efficiently and the interviewers are more interested in seeing how candidates use these tools to solve a problem. Just like a car mechanic needs the right tool to fix a car and make it run properly, a programmer needs the right tool (algorithm and data structure) to make the software run properly. So the interviewer wants to find a candidate who can apply the right set of tools to solve
          the given problem.If you know the characteristics of one data structure in contrast to another 
          you will be able to make the right decision in choosing the right data structure to solve a problem.</p>

      <div class="questions">
        <h2 class="question">
          Being a beginner, how and where do I start with the data structure and algorithm?
        </h2>
        <p class="answer">
          Learning data structure is very important when you want to in Big Companies Like Google,Amazon etc.
   
          To learn all the data structure first you need to learn All basics
          Array, Stack, Queue, Linked List, Binary search, Depth first search, Breath-First search.
           Time/Space Complexity, Infix,Prefix, Post-fix,
           Trees and Graph,sorting, Searching, Hashing.
          After learning All the basics, you should Proceed to the ADVANCED Topics
          Algorithm Analysis:Techniques eg. Substitution method,Master Method, etc..
          Dynamic Programming:- General Approach
          BACKTRACKING Method:- N-queen problem, sum of subsets, Generation of all cliques etc.
          Lower Bound Theory:- Decision Tree, Reduction Method etc
        </p>

    <div class="questions">
      <h2 class="question">
        I'm a 2nd year CS student. I failed the Data Structures course. Am I not suitable for writing code?
      </h2>
      <p class="answer">
        No, of course not. You are suitable to write code. 
        Nowadays it is sufficient for you to learn best practices on what kind of data structre is best suited for certain tasks 
        and there are plenty of frameworks with built in functionality that can absolutely allow you to write code without you having a single idea  
        what is the difference between an array, a sorted list, binary tree, stack or whatever other data structure you may want to use.
